# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Really struggled with the Twitch API project I'm working on for FCC. Reviewed youtube and stackoverflow but wasnt sure how to iterate over multiple objects. In the end, I asked for help on the FCC forum so hopefully I can do better tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** It's hard getting back into the swing of things when you've taken a 10 day break from coding.
